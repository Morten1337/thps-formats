# thps-formats

A Python library for working with file formats used in the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game series.  

*It also serves as a consolidation and documentation of old code I have lying around, which I intend to port to Python...  
But as of now, it's mostly full of incomplete random garbage. However, the q script stuff is functionally complete for the most part.*

## installing/building for development
```shell
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

## running tests
```shell
$ python -m pytest tests/
```

## future
- refactor and organize the code to align more closely with the project description.
	- define the scope and intended features of the library.
	- design a more consistent api for format interoperability and data manipulation.
- move example apps out of this repository.
